Phase 2 challenge first attempt


# Phase 2 Interview Challenge

This is the challenge for getting into phase 2.

To get started, create a new repository called `phase-2-challenge`. Do all of your work in this repo and submit it as your solution.

Skills covered:

- Programming
- Programming in JS
- Testing
- Node.js
- HTML & CSS
- Terminal, Bash, & UNIX

Each requirement has a point value. A fully complete requirement gets full points; partially complete requirements get partial points; incomplete requirements get no points. Completeness is determined by calculating points earned divided by total points available.

## General Requirements

- [x] __10:__ Solution is in a public GitHub repository called `phase-2-challenge`.
- [x] __10:__ Solution repository has 4 folders: `part-1`, `part-2`, and `part-3`, and `part-4`.
- [x] __20:__ Git history shows frequent commits.

## Part 1: Write tests and solutions for these functions

For the following exercises, write your functions in a file called `part-1/functions.js` and your tests in a file called `part-1/tests.js`.

You can use whichever testing tools you prefer: `console.assert()` (builtin to Node), Mocha and Chai, Jasmine, etc.

### Show a month

Write a function `month(date)` to find the month for a given `Date` object, returing the name of the month as a string ('January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', ... etc).

Example:

```js
let date = new Date(2017, 5, 19) // June 19, 2017
month(date) // returns "June"

let christmas = new Date(2017, 11, 25) // Dec 25, 2017
month(christmas) // returns "December"
```

#### Requirements

- [x] __10:__ A test using expected/valid inputs for the `month()` function is written in `tests.js`.
- [x] __10:__ A test using unexpected/invalid inputs for the `month()` function is written in `tests.js`.
- [x] __30:__ Correct implementation of the `month()` is defined in `functions.js`.
- [x] __10:__ Tests for `month()` are passing.

### Reverse a sentence

Write a function `reverseSentence(string)` that takes a string of words and returns a string with the words in reverse order. If there is only one word in the string return it unchanged. Consider any series of non-space characters a word.

Example:

```js
reverseSentence("The cat jumped over the dog.") // => "dog. the over jumped cat The"
reverseSentence("Hello, world!") // => "world! Hello,"
```

#### Requirements

- [ ] __10:__ A test using expected/valid inputs for the `reverseSentence()` function is written in `tests.js`.
- [ ] __10:__ A test using unexpected/invalid inputs for the `reverseSentence()` function is written in `tests.js`.
- [ ] __30:__ Correct implementation of the `reverseSentence()` is defined in `functions.js`.
- [ ] __10:__ Tests for `reverseSentence()` are passing.

### Names of properties

Write a function `nameProps(obj)` that returns the names of the properties an object has in alphabetical order. Ignore symbolic properties and count only the "own properties" (not inherited) of the object.

Example:

```js
let friend = {
  name: 'Dominique',
  age: 30,
  phone: '555-555-5555'
}

nameProps(friend) // => ['age', 'name', 'phone']
nameProps({}) // => []
```

#### Requirements

- [ ] __10:__ A test using expected/valid inputs for the `nameProps()` function is written in `tests.js`.
- [ ] __10:__ A test using unexpected/invalid inputs for the `nameProps()` function is written in `tests.js`.
- [ ] __30:__ Correct implementation of the `nameProps()` is defined in `functions.js`.
- [ ] __10:__ Tests for `nameProps()` are passing.

### Filter between

Write a function `filterBetween(array, min, max)` that takes an array of strings, a `min` value, and a `max` value. It returns a new array containing _only_ the elements that come after `min` alphabetically and before `max`.

Example:

```js
let arr = ['dog', 'cat', 'zebra', 'ape', 'lion', 'cow']

filterBetween(arr, 'deer', 'giraffe') // => ['dog']
filterBetween(arr, 'chimp', 'lobster') // => ['dog', 'lion', 'cow']
filterBetween(arr, 'chickadee', 'chimpanzee') // => []
```

#### Requirements

- [ ] __10:__ A test using expected/valid inputs for the `filterBetween()` function is written in `tests.js`.
- [ ] __10:__ A test using unexpected/invalid inputs for the `filterBetween()` function is written in `tests.js`.
- [ ] __30:__ Correct implementation of the `filterBetween()` is defined in `functions.js`.
- [ ] __10:__ Tests for `filterBetween()` are passing.

## Part 2: Extract data from JSON file

Write a Node.js script to search for data from a JSON file.

Use the [`clients.json` file provided](https://gist.github.com/lg-bot/7832b0582f86e9bf4699c1cd633b8794#file-clients-json) representing a database of company contacts. Download the file to your `part-2/` folder.

Then write two scripts that can be run using the `node` command.

1. `searchByCompany.js` takes one string argument (let's call it `company`), finds all the clients from `clients.json` who have a `company` that starts with the `company` string, and prints the `id`, `company` and `phone` of each matching client.
1. `searchByCity.js` takes one string argument (let's call it the `city`), finds all the clients from `clients.json` who have a `city` that _exactly matches_ the `city`, and prints the `id`, `rep_name`, `company`, `city`, and `state` of each matching client.

Your searches should not be case-sensitive: i.e. a search for "Boston" is the same as a search for "boston".

Example: `searchByCompany.js`

```shell
$ node searchByCompany.js Ab
Finding companies with name "Ab"...

[
  {
    "id": 3,
    "company": "Abbott-Bins",
    "phone": "1-(617)668-9817"
  },
  {
    "id": 13,
    "company": "Abernathy-Schuster",
    "phone": "1-(562)758-3202"
  }
]
```

Example: `searchByCity.js`

```shell
$ node searchByCity.js Boston
Finding clients in City "Boston"...

[
  {
    "id": 3,
    "rep_name": "Ronnie Benasik",
    "company": "Abbott-Bins",
    "city": "Boston",
    "state": "Massachusetts"
  },
  {
    "id": 24,
    "rep_name": "Etan Chastang",
    "company": "Herman Inc",
    "city": "Boston",
    "state": "Massachusetts"
  },
  {
    "id": 92,
    "rep_name": "Jeromy Upston",
    "company": "Maggio, Monahan and Feest",
    "city": "Boston",
    "state": "Massachusetts"
  },
  {
    "id": 100,
    "rep_name": "Andria Kain",
    "company": "O'Connell, Langworth and Wisoky",
    "city": "Boston",
    "state": "Massachusetts"
  }
]
```

#### Requirements

- [ ] __40:__ `searchByCompany.js` script prints the client  `id`, `phone`, and `company` for all clients whose `company` starts with the provided `company` argument.
- [ ] __40:__ `searchByCity.js` script prints the client `id`, `rep_name`, `company`, `city`, and `state` that for all clients whose `city` matches the provided `city` argument.
